# cs282_deep_learning

This repository contains all the implementations I've completed for the UC Berkeley CS 282: Visualizing Deep Neural Network class.

- Homework 1: Neural networks I (dense neural networks, convolutional neural networks, optimizers, loss functions, activation functions, etc.)
- Homework 2: Neural networks II (recurrent neural networks, LSTM cells, embeddings, etc.)
- Homework 3: Language modeling (transformers, attentions, etc.)
- Homework 4: Visual transformers (ViT)
